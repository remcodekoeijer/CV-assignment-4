Use hog.detectMultiScale with the weighted output. 
Output gives you vector of rectangles -> the bounding boxes
OUtput gives you vector of weights -> how well a bounding box is working
Play around with the parameters for better results

NMS
You get several bounding boxes in 1 image. These are all a result. You only want 1 result per image
Basic idea: (from slides10, slide 35)
• Sort detections based on detection score (highest first)
• Iteratively remove bounding boxes that overlap with those with higher detection scores
  So check how much both bounding boxes overlap. If they overlap for more than 50%, remove it. If not, it's possible it is a second detection.

IoU (intersection over union)
If 2 boxes overlap, get their intersection (the common area) and the union (the area they have together: box1.area + box2.area - intersection). If you do I / U and it's above a certain threshold, it's overlapping.
